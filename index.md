## Sci-Fi Movies and Series
  We all know that Science is cool, especially if you try learning new things everyday. When learning, reading can be very boring, I personally see it as boring and it makes me very sleepy. However, there are many solutions to that, and one that I like the most is watching movies about it. Here are some movies that will help you learn about Science while also being very entertaining.
  
### Star Trek

  One of my favorite series about science. It takes place around 150+ years from now, where people abord starships venture across the galaxy and encounter new species and new worlds. It's a very interesting series with a total watch time (combined series and movie) of 651 hours and 48 minutes. A lot of science stuff goes on, it also shows good examples of problem-solving and critical thinking which is essential to every single person.
