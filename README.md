## Sci-Fi Movies and Series
  We all know that Science is cool, especially if you try learning new things everyday. When learning, reading can be very boring, I personally see it as boring and it makes me very sleepy. However, there are many solutions to that, and one that I like the most is watching movies about it. Here are some movies that will help you learn about Science while also being very entertaining.
  
### Star Trek

  One of my favorite series about science. It takes place around 150+ years from now, where people abord starships venture across the galaxy and encounter new species and new worlds. It's a very interesting series with a total watch time (combined series and movie) of 651 hours and 48 minutes. A lot of science stuff goes on, it also shows good examples of problem-solving and critical thinking which is essential to every single person.
  
### Interstellar

  A really good and very meaningful movie, it takes place in the near future where dust displaced many food crops. The economy started failing, there's no other choice but to find a new home for humanity. They travel to a stable wormhole found just outside Saturn. It tackles the physics behind black holes and the science of gravity. Not only is it fun but it will also make your brain think of many possible outcomes, it will make you theorize a lot of stuff.
  
 ### Cloverfield Trilogy
